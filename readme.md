## COMMANDS:
    >> npm i express => run this command to install the needed packages
    
    >> TO INSTALL NODEMON: npm i nodemon

In earlier methods, we first used to convert the data into array/string, which was kind of improper. 

But in EXPRESS we don't need to do the stuff like that.

*************IMP***************
ALWAYS write the KEY and the VALUE in the STRING format only.
*************IN JSON DATA*********

/*ALL THE GENERIC STATS NEED TO BE WRITTEN ON THE BOTTOM i.e. after all the conditions are written*/
